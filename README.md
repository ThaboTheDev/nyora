# nyora â€“ Iteration 1: Skeleton & Movement

This is **Iteration 1** of a terminal-based open-world adventure game built in Dart.  
At this stage the game is a simple ASCII world where a player character (`@`) can move around a map using keyboard controls.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of Iteration 1

- Set up the Dart project structure.
- Build the core game loop (`input â†’ update â†’ render`).
- Create a small hard-coded ASCII map.
- Implement a movable player character with collision detection.
- Render everything in the terminal using ANSI characters.
- Provide a clean exit (`q` to quit).

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure (Iteration 1)

```bash
adventure_game/
â”œâ”€ bin/
â”‚  â””â”€ main.dart          # Entry point â€“ starts the game
â”œâ”€ lib/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ core/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ game.dart       # Main game loop
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ input.dart      # Handles keyboard input
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ renderer.dart   # Draws the world in the terminal
â”‚  â”œâ”€ world/
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ world.dart      # Map data & terrain logic
â”‚  â””â”€ entities/
â”‚     â””â”€ player.dart     # Player entity

## Controls

| Key | Action     |
| --- | ---------- |
| `W` | Move Up    |
| `A` | Move Left  |
| `S` | Move Down  |
| `D` | Move Right |
| `Q` | Quit Game  |

## ðŸ›  Features Implemented in This Iteration

- Core game loop in Game class.

- Hardcoded ASCII map and terrain.

- Player entity with position and movement.

- Collision detection with walls.

- Terminal rendering using ANSI escape codes.

- Simple input handling from the keyboard.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps (Future Iterations)

- Load maps from external files instead of hardcoding.

- Add NPCs and items to interact with.

- Add combat, inventory, and quests.

- Build a multiplayer skeleton using Dart server + WebSockets.
